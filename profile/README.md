# Penticton High School Coding Club

Welcome to the official GitHub profile for the Penticton High School Coding Club! We are a group of students who are passionate about learning and developing our skills in full-stack web development.

Here, you'll find the projects that we've worked on as a club, including front-end and back-end web development, databases and more.

We meet regularly to discuss and work on projects, and we welcome anyone who is interested in learning more about coding to join us!

Feel free to browse through our repositories and learn more about what we've been working on. If you're interested in joining our club or have any questions, please reach out to one of our members or join us in room #___ thursdays at lunch.

Together, we can build amazing things!
